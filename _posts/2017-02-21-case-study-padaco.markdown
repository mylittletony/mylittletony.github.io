<h2>What do you use Cucumber for?</h2>

<p>At the time, we found Cucumber for a large summer festival. We supported more than 4000 connections. After the festival was over, we continued to use Cucumber because it’s easy to set up and allows users to connect via social media.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like Cucumber?</h2>

<p>We were looking for a solution that could block free WiFi access but still be able to collect data.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>Being able to manage a large networks easily. We didn’t experience any problems when there were over 4000 connections.</p>

<p>We also like the splash page feature like Facebook check-in, and being able to limit users’ time spent on the WiFi network. Our sales and marketing team is thinking about how to market this feature to our clients.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>Not for now. We’re looking forward to more features we can share with our clients.</p>

<p>Thanks Frank and Daniel! It’s been great to hear your unique experience. We’ll be sure to bring more features you’ll love!</p>
