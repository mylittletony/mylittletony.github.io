<h2>What is it?</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Health Check runs a selection of checks on your box to see if there are any potential issues. The things it checks are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Internet Check</b> - This checks if the box has a working internet connection</li>
<li><b>DNS Check</b> - This checks if the box can reach a DNS server</li>
<li><b>MTU Check</b> - This compares the MTU of the box with the MTU used on your network</li>
<li><b>Connected to Cucumber</b> - This checks if the box can reach the Cucumber Tony servers</li>
<li><b>Splash Pages</b> - This checks if there are splash pages running on your network</li>
<li><b>In Sync</b> - This checks if your box's configuration matches up to what it should be in Cucumber Tony</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Common issues</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Your box MTU is too high. Reduce this or increase on your modem.</strong>
</p>
<p>To change the MTU settings on the box just follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Head into Boxes on the left hand sidebar</li>
	<li>Click on the box that you want to make changes on</li>
	<li>Click on Settings across the top of the page</li>
	<li>Scroll down for a section called Connectivity Settings</li>
	<li>You will find a field for changing your MTU here</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend dropping your MTU on the box by 8 from that of your network.
