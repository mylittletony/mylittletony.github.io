##How do I tell if wireless issues are down to my device, router, or broadband?

Troubleshooting connectivity issues can be hard sometimes, and it’s easy to blame the first step in the ladder for your downfall. But it’s not always as simple as that. Here is a very brief guide on some checks you can do to find out the cause of your woes and potentially fix it yourself.

###Your Device <hr>
First thing you will want to check the device that you are using. Give it the much loved method of turning the WiFi off and then on again. 

If that doesn’t fix it, then you can try moving closer to the wireless signal, or depending on the device that you are using, try out a different web browser. 

If you still can’t get your device online, try connecting to the WiFi again with another device. If this one works, then there is a high chance that the issue is with that specific device. This way you know where to focus your attention.

###Access Points and Routers <hr>
If there are no issues with your device, then you can move up the chain. Check out any access points you have between you and your modem. Give the access points a reboot, and then test again.

If you have a tool such as Cucumber Tony, you can use it to help diagnose the issues. If the access points are not showing as online on your tool, but you have powered them on, then your safest bet is that the issue is down to connectivity. 

A lot of the more in depth diagnosing can be pretty time consuming, but there are some tools out there that can help you with this. if you’re using Cucumber Tony, there is something called the doctor script. This handy tool will run a quick row of tests to check things like internet connectivity and if the correct processes are running on your access point.

If your access points are having troubles with connectivity, then it is time to move up the chain yet again. Take a look at any switches, routers or modems you are using. And get yourself a device (such as a laptop) and ethernet cable.

One by one as you move further up the chain of hardware, plug your device into the switches as you go, and check to see if you can get internet access. 

Once you find the point where you can get internet access, you know that the issue is somewhere before this point, so you can check things like replacing cables or making sure the hardware is configured properly.

###Broadband <hr>
If you are still unable to get connectivity when connecting directly into devices, right up to your router/modem, then there is almost certainly either an issue with your modem, or an issue with your broadband connection.

Run your checks on your modem, and if that turns up nothing, then it is time to give your ISP a call.
