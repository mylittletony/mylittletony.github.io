<h1>How Benito's Hat Use CT WiFi</h1>
<p>Walter is operations manager of a chain of Mexican restaurants. Benito’s serve by far the best burritos in town. Walters talks to us about why he uses CT WiFi to run his Wi-Fi.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>
<p>Benito’s Hat is a casual Mexican restaurant serving fresh and modern food. We have 8 sites across London and we’re growing. We use CT WiFi to manage the guest Wi-Fi access and design and brand the user experience.</p>
<h2>Why do you use CT WiFi?</h2>
<p>We need Wi-Fi our customers can use when they visit a Benitos restaurant. We wanted to stand out from the crowd and brand the welcome splash page and network name to Benitos. We looked at the public Wi-Fi options from BT, The Cloud and O2 and they didn’t let you do that. You had to use “The Cloud” as the network name. CT WiFi gives us a white label Wi-Fi network we can brand to ourselves.</p>
<h2>What problem does CT WiFi fix for you?</h2>
<p>One of our sites in King Cross station. It’s really busy and we compete with a lot of other businesses. Our Wi-Fi needed to stand out — so we looked for a solution we could manage and brand.</p>
