###Note: You have to be on the same network as the Access Point to connect to the local portal.
**The doctor doesn't work on the public WiFi network**

To run the script, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>
Connect to the Access Point using one of these methods:<br>
- The private network<br>
- Directly via ethernet cable<br>
- Over your WAN using your box's IP<br>
</li>

<li>Enter the following into your browser's address bar: <br>
<a href="polka.box/doctor">polka.box/doctor</a> <br>
</li>

<li>If you aren't already logged in, it will prompt you for a username and password.<br>
- The username for the local portal is currently always polkaspots.<br>
- Your password is the serial number of the box, as so:
