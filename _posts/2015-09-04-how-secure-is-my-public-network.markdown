description: A couple pointers on keeping your public network as secure as possible.
---

In this day and age, there are a lot of threats from the digital world. So if you are going to open up your network to the public and offer WiFi access, there are a few things that you should do to help protect yourself from these would be dangers.

###Stick a password on it <hr>
First and foremost, you don't want to offer complete access to your network to the public. You don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry accessing the entirety of your private network after all. So you will want to separate your private and public networks.

This means creating different SSIDs, and ensuring that your private one is password protected. You can even go as far to have your public SSID password protected, and distribute the password how you see fit if you really want to.

Remember, a *public* WiFi network doesn't necessarily mean it has to be an *open* network.

###Lock it down <hr>

If you are inviting people into your store or cafe, or other place of business, you are going to want to make sure that any access points and other network equipment are safe and secure. You can do everything possible to secure the WiFi but if Tom can just walk into your shop, pull out a cable and plug himself directly into your network, then it is all for nothing.

Keep your modem and routers in a private place, and ensure that any APs you have are out of direct reach and fixed in place (<a href="https://cucumberwifi.io/community/tutorials/installing-your-wifi-access-points.html">but don't lock them away in a cage</a>, WiFi has feelings too!). 

Depending on what you are going to be using the WiFi for, some regulations such as the PCI requires you to do things like these, so you will want to ensure you are compliant.

###Moderate the access <hr>

Once you start providing public WiFi access, you will want to ensure that it is not being abused.

Ideally, you will want to have a captive portal in place or other means to keep track of any abuse of your network. If Harry starts using your network for some nefarious activities, you will want to be able to prove that it was not you that did them.

As well as keeping track of abuse like this, you might also want to put in place other rules such as bandwidth restrictions and idle timeouts on your public network. You don't want to water down the experience too much, but by putting in limits you will protect against other abuse. Things like users who might want to connect to your network and leave their torrent sharing software running and eating up your bandwidth.

If you have a captive portal, you can even restrict the access to the network through it via setting the access to require a voucher, password or social login, rather than a standard clickthrough page.

On top of this, you should also ideally make use of more advanced features such as Client Isolation. This prevents a device that is connected to your network wirelessly from accessing computers and resources that are connected to the network by wireless or wired. As the name suggests, it essentially isolates that client on your wireless network. And this feature in particular will help keep both your network secure, as well as the other users on your network.
