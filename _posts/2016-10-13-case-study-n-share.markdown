<h1>How N-Share Uses Cucumber</h1>
<p>Rafael from N-share is building a database for his clients with a marketing platform. He uses Cucumber’s API integration to create the ideal platform for his business.</p>

<h2>What’s the Name of Your Company</h2>

<p>N-Share</p>

<h2>What’s your name?</h2>

<p>Rafael Mesquita.</p>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>We’re a digital marketing company based in Brazil. We use WiFi to gather information and offer guest access to the users. The users send information about themselves, receive coupons or even watch a video.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about Cucumber?</h2>

<p>Through Google.</p>

<h2>What do you use Cucumber for?</h2>

<p>As we have our own marketing and business intelligence platform, we use Cucumber for the network management and use the splash pages. We use the API to integrate the platform with ours.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like Cucumber?</h2>

<p>In Brazil, the WiFi marketing business is blooming. We’re ahead of the competition and we were looking for a more affordable solution so we could offer our clients more than just Meraki, Aruba or Aerohive. We did find some other platforms but Cucumber had the best hardware options.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>We use the custom registration splash pages and it’s great the end users don’t need to complete the form again to sign in if they’ve been somewhere before.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>Keep up the good work!</p>


<p>That’s what we like to hear — Cucumber integrating with other platforms. Thanks Rafael! :)</p>
