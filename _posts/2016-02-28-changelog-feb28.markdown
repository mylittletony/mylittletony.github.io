**Splash Page Timeout**
<br><br>
You can now set a timeout for your splash pages when using timed access. 
<br><br>
This allows you to control the amount of time before the splash is seen again. For example, you set up two splash pages - clickthrough and vouchers. You want the clickthrough to appear for 2 hours per day. After which they need to use a voucher code.
<br><br>
Set the timeout on the clickthrough splash to 90 days and, after their two hours has been used, they will only see the voucher page.
<br><br>
**Login Page Triggers**
<br><br>
You can now trigger an event when someone logs in.
<br><br>
**Bug Fixes**
<br><br>
- Fixes the redirect URL that wasn't saving previously
<br>
- Fixes the blank error message on the login pages
