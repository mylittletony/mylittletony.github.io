<h1>How Suffolk Libraries Use Cucumber</h1>
<p>Suffolk Libraries has been a customer for many years. Today they share their story in hopes others who have a similar network can learn from their experience.</p>

<h2>What’s the Name of Your Company</h2>

<p>Suffolk Libraries</p>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>We’re a not for profit, independent and charitable organisation set up in August 2012 to run the service for the benefit of the people of Suffolk. All libraries in Suffolk are run by Suffolk Libraries. We’re contracted by Suffolk County Council to run the service.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about Cucumber?</h2>

<p>We’re also a <a href="http://www.polkaspots.com/">PolkaSpots</a> customer. At the time we were looking for a centralised WiFi management solution and found Cucumber to be a handy tool to work with.</p>

<h2>What do you use Cucumber for?</h2>

<p>We use Cucumber to manage WiFi connectivity for all libraries in Suffolk.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like Cucumber?</h2>

<p>To manage multiple sites in one place. A lot of libraries in Suffolk are very far away. Some take an hour’s drive to get there. Being able to remotely check the issue saves us a lot of time.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>The chat feature is great. It’s much easier to find in the new platform and the response time is immediate. Where some of the libraries are located, they don’t always have phone signal. Being able to chat to someone and get our problems resolved quickly is very helpful.</p>

<h2>Any features you’d like to see added?</h2>

<p>As we manage 50 sites that have similar network requirements, it would be great to have more features where we can add or edit the networks in Bulk. We’d also like to see a device map where all our APs are plotted on the map for us to see immediately which ones are offline and need our attention.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>I like the new Cucumber layout. The flatness and design makes it easy to navigate and find things in the dashboard.</p>

<p>Thanks Steph! We’re glad to hear Cucumber has helped make managing your sites easier.</p>
