      <p>You get 40% off the monthly plans and 30% off the yearly ones (because it's already discounted).</p>
      <p>You get all the features of the real plans. No ifs or buts. Pretty much the only condition of use, aside from our standard terms, is that you don't resell your plan to anyone else. It's not supposed to be there to make you money, the discount is to help you.</p>
      <p>You need to be a not-for-profit and have all the correct certificates etc.</p>
