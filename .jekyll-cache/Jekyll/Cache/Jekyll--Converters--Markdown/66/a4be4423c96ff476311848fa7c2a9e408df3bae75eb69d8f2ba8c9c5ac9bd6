I"f<p>Jon is the IT guy at Exmoor National Park. We’re quite jealous of his job as he gets to work in the park which is beautiful.</p>

<p>Seriously look how amazing it is…</p>

<p>Anyway the visitors there still need Wi-Fi and it’s his job to run the guest Wi-Fi network across five visitor centres. These are spread around all corners of the park with about 25 miles in between each one.
Because Jon manages his Wi-Fi using the CT WiFi web interface he doesn’t have to drive to each site to make a change or fix an issue.</p>

<p>Here’s how he does it.</p>

<p>###In your own words who are Exmoor National Parks?###</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re a local authority so we serve the public. We’re here to conserve the parks for everyone to enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###Why do you use CT WiFi?###</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To manage the guest Wi-Fi at the visitor centres remotely. We don’t want the staff on site to be responsible for managing the Wi-Fi access points. The fact I can manage all the sites from one web browser gives the IT team the control and saves me driving 25 miles between each site to change a setting or reboot a box.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We use the guest splash pages to make it easy for visitors to connect. We’re a local authority so it’s important we cater for all types of users. We didn’t want a complicated login process as it wouldn’t serve the public well. We also use the captive portal and content filtering settings to prevent abuse and cover us for any illegal downloads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###What do you like about CT WiFi?###</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact it saves me time. I don’t want to devote hours of my week to managing the Wi-Fi network so the web interface is a real time saver.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I want to make a change it takes me seconds. The management zones really speed this up. You put multiple APs into a zone and change the settings across that zone. You make one change instead of 20.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The who’s online stats show me the network is running correctly so if there’s an issue I don’t need to drive to site to fix it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are also features in there that make the network run smoothly — like being able to schedule a regular reboot for the access points. This keeps them ticking over and prevents them crashing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###What’s your favourite thing about CT WiFi?###</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no licence cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###Anything else you’d like to add?###</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s IT and things do go wrong so I like being able to speak to the support team. They’re really helpful and will fix something for me on the spot if they can.</p>
